The topic I chose to research was the housing scheme. We began with the narrowing of the topic; the author chooses to focus on artisan, which is a cool focus, in my opinion. However, I think it's odd the blame the inability for stable housing due to the need for artisan housing. The [article "Water supply of ancient Egyptian settlements: the role of the state." ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12685-015-0150-x) describes the housing standards in a pessimistic view, going so far as to call the "rat hole" quality housing. She justifies this due to a lack of water and gas access. She tries to see the landlord's perception and assumes they don't bother investing because they know the land is worthless. Even though the quality is so poor, the artisans still have to pay an unfair price due to the over-taxation of everyone during this time period. One of the links to the blog posts describes a story of how one of these houses collapsed. The other blog post links and one of the outside links deceives the hardships of getting access to stable water.

They are further proving that these claims were not totally unwarranted. The author ends the argument with the economic problems of paying rent and getting proper housing. In addition, My final outside website link led to a research article about the financial issues of the time. After completing my research, it appears all the researcher's claims are valid; it shocks me how unfair things were back in those times.
